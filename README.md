# js snake

A JavaScript snake app I created-
Try it out [here](https://mattlub.github.io/js-snake/), or feel free to clone it and play around with the options yourself.

### Motivations
After making a tic tac toe game, I thought of another simple game that would be slightly more challenging. I wanted to make the JavaScript easy to follow for others.

### Useful things learnt
- Mimicking animation with setInterval- though this may not be a great way to do it.
- Managing event listeners for keydowns.

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] 1/12/16: make js more modular, e.g. separate out updating DOM etc.
- [ ] 2/12/16: add customisable options/game modes
- [ ] 2/12/16: add highscores table and screenshots of final positions
- [ ] 2/12/16: add "autopilot" mode
- [ ] 2/12/16: add speed increase as game goes on?
- [ ] 2/12/16: amend generateFood function, as it will currently struggle if there are not many free squares and probably crash if you fill the whole board.

### Collaboration
Any contributions/comments are welcome- I'd especially be interested to hear ways in which other people would approach making this game!
